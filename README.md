# E-Commerce-Back-End

In this project, the challenge was to build the back end for an e-commerce site. We were to take a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

Because this application wonâ€™t be deployed, we were also required to create a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the following acceptance criteria being met.

# 1) User Story

AS A manager at an internet retail company

I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies

SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies

# 2) Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a functional Express.js API

WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file

THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize

WHEN I enter schema and seed commands

THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data

WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application



THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database

WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags

THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core

THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
